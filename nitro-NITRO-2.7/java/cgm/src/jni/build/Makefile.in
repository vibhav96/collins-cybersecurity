# change local makefiles without discussing it with #

# To add new library files to the effort, add them  #
# to the SOURCES variable.  Make sure that they are #
# located in the source/ directory.  To add new     #
# test cases, add them to the TESTS variable, and   #
# place the tests in the tests/ subdirectory.       #
